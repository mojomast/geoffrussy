# Requirements Document: Geoffrussy AI Coding Agent

## Introduction

Geoffrussy is a next-generation AI-powered development orchestration platform that reimagines human-AI collaboration on software projects. The system prioritizes deep project understanding through a multi-stage iterative pipeline: Interview → Architecture Design → DevPlan Generation → Phase Review. Each stage includes review points where users can approve, iterate, or refine before proceeding. Built in Go as a single binary, Geoffrussy serves as a sophisticated development companion that transforms requirements into executable plans while maintaining transparency and control throughout the entire development lifecycle.
